    <div>NAVIGATION</div>
    <div>Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.
        The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.
        It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating
        the navigator's position compared to known locations or patterns.
        Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction. In this sense, navigation includes
        orienteering and pedestrian navigation.
